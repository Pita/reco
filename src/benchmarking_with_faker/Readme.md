This is a different approach of benchmarking. The main idea is to give a huge workload for the regex that it needs to work through one by one and can't take any shortcut. This should create benchmarking results more close to reality compared to just looping over the same code many times. Simply looping over code does not work well with JIT engines as it starts to optimize the code in unrealistic ways.
